competencies in: 
  1. Instructional design 
  2. Visual learning creation

  4. Fashion retail-specific content development 
  5. Built using Canva to combine learning design with brand-aligned visuals 
  6. Rooted in fashion retail operations 
  7. Manually tested for WCAG 2.2 compliance, ensuring accessibility for a wide range of learners 
These modules were created in Canva using interactive design features such as clickable tabs,
